## Tutorial1: Introduction to Simulation and Synthesis

This tutorial provides a brief introduction to the tools that are going to
be used for design of ASIC systems.  To this end, we will be using Mentor
Graphics Modelsim for simulation and the Synopsys Design Compiler
environment for synthesis.  It is interesting to note that the Modelsim tool
enables compilation of multiple design/verification/modeling units (each of
which might be in a different language) into a common library (called the
working library) and a common design representation.  This enables each
individual unit of the entire simulation to be compiled independently and
incremental compilation to be performed.

This tutorial was developed using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstation
running RHEL 7.7-10el.7.

To get started, see Tutorial1.doc or Tutorial1.pdf in this directory.

This tutorial was originally developed for ECE 520.  We would happily
entertain any pull requests from students that are willing to help improve
it!
